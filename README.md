The Life and Times of HUX3LY

Hi!

I am very new to GitHub and I am attempting to embark on a new path for my life and career. Currently, I am a mental health counselor and work with the seriously mentally ill in a inpatient locked mental health facility. My desire is to educate myself in the art of coding and to ultimately become a computer programmer and leave my current field of expertise. 

I live in Bellingham, Washington with my beautiful wife and son who attends school out of state.
